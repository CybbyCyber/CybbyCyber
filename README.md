Hi everyone, my name's Mario and i've started to code in 2022, 
I think I still have a lot to learn but i'm discovering many ways to have fun with coding and I'm not going to stop, 
I aspire to edit videogames, robots and advanced artificial intelligences, 
I hope to belong to some group to which I can give my contribution. 
I am moving towards the complete knowledge about Python, C++(maybe JavaScript, SQL, Java and R) and a lot of libraries.
In this moment i'm studing wxWidgets to create GUIs which make uses of wxChartDir and FANN.
